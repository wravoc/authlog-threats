1. Only the settings file(s) that accompany and were intended by the Creator to use with the Software, obtained with the Software may be used.
1. Any customization is strictly only for allowing the proper Execution of the Software as-is, in whole, separate from the Executable Software in *conformance* with the means of the Software.


Examples of how the Software may be customized:.
1. **The first line** of the Software, commonly referred to as the *shebang*, where the execution environment is defined for the Software to Execute, the Licensee can modify this line only to set the proper Execution method.
1. Any settings file that were originally obtained with the Software inside.





### Section 4 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.
